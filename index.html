      <article id="introduction">
      <p>It’s been three years. Three of years Gritty, of the Eagles having a Super Bowl title, of me being in Philadelphia after leaving my home state of thirty years. As I’ve joined my new community, everyone always asks me, “Why? Why would you leave Oregon? And why <em>here?</em>” Well, let’s take a crack at putting the mystery to rest.</p>

      <h2>Oregon has it out for me.</h2>

      <p>When people think of Oregon, they often think about the incredible landscapes&#8211lush forests, snowcapped mountains, rolling vineyards, rugged shorelines. What people don’t think about is the state’s top agricultural product: grass seed. Yes, they produce 75% of the world’s grass seed supply, and what comes with that? The worst place imaginable for people with hay fever. Think you’re lucky and don’t have hay fever? Give it a few years; after being assaulted with pollen for long enough, many transplants start feeling the effects as well.</p>

      <article id="diversity">
      <h2>It’s really… vanilla. And not in the "tasty ice cream" way.</h2>
      <p>Okay, there's no sugarcoating it. Oregon is very white. Like, uncomfortably white. In the 1970s, 97% of the population was white. It’s getting more diverse, but slowly; something like 85% now. People defending Oregon as diverse cite specific towns as examples, but if you need to say you have a particular town that has a particular demographic to claim being diverse, you’re not doing great in that department. If you’re into being among a diversity of cultures, languages, races, and ethnicities, things get bland very quickly. A lot of this goes back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_black_exclusion_laws">racial exclusionary laws in the 19th century</a>&#8211a detail they neglected to mention back when I was in school.</p>

      <article id="transportation">
      <h2>Hope you like to drive. I don’t.</h2>
      <p>If you like towns with expansive surface level parking lots and large lawns, or you want to live in a remote cabin, you’re in for a treat! Outside of Portland’s urban core, nearly the entire state is suburban or rural, and it’s almost mandatory to drive to get anywhere. Personally, I hate driving, and don’t hold a driver’s license. There are some bikeable towns, but they aren’t cities. Portland’s public transportation is actually pretty good, but it’s still sprawly, and the other above-mentioned points make it less than ideal for me.</p>

      <h2>And so… Philly!</h2>

      <p>I tell people that I basically moved here after researching it on Wikipedia. And that’s pretty much what happened. I wanted a large, urban, diverse, relatively affordable city in an area that isn’t commercially farming grass, and this is where I landed, sight unseen until I stepped off the airplane. It’s been an amazing decision and I love my adopted home. Yes, the city has its own challenges, but it is such a better fit, and I hope to spend many more years here!</p>
      <p>I do love Oregon, and it will always have a special place in my heart, but it just wasn’t the right fit for me. Also, a lot of the state has been on fire for the last few years, so that’s a bit of a problem as well.</p>
